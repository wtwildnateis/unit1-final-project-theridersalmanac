Just want to tap into the local <span className="textstrong">ride culture</span>? You’re in the right place. Around here, it’s not just about where you’re headed — it’s about how you get there.

                        A little about me: I'm Nate. I’ve been riding bikes almost as long as I’ve been able to stand. I’ve spent over 15 years riding BMX at a professional level and even ran my own BMX company — so when I say I live and breathe bikes, I mean it. I built this app to be the ultimate hub for riders like you and me — a place to find everything you need to hit the streets, trails, or parks and connect with others who share the same passion.

                        So clip in, gear up, and let The Rider’s Almanac <span className="textstrong">guide your next adventure</span>.</div>
